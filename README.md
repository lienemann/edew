# EDEW 2.0
## EDEW - A simulation and optimization tool for fluid handling by electrowetting effects

This is the source code and Java archive for my thesis work on the simulation and optimization of electrowetting.

Please see the PDFs for documentation or my thesis which is available at https://freidok.uni-freiburg.de/data/2897 (URN: [urn:nbn:de:bsz:25-opus-28970](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:25-opus-28970))

Also please note that the last update of the code was 2004 and it probably will not run any more on recent version of Java. Contributions welcome.
